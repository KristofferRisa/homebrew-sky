# homebrew-sky
Homebrew formula for https://github.com/KristofferRisa/sky-cli

## Install

```bash
brew tap kristofferrisa/sky
brew install kristofferrisa/sky/sky
```

Or in one command:

```bash
brew install kristofferrisa/sky/sky
```

**Note:** You must use the fully qualified name `kristofferrisa/sky/sky` (not just `brew install sky`) because an existing cask named `sky` takes precedence otherwise.
